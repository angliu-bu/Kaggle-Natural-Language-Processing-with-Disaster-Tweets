# Kaggle-Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets
Kaggle Project. Rank 19/1351. Top 1.4%. Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets. Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. 

Competition Description
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. Take this example:

The author explicitly uses the word “ABLAZE” but means it metaphorically. This is clear to a human right away, especially with the visual aid. But it’s less clear to a machine.

In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. If this is your first time working on an NLP problem, we've created a quick tutorial to get you up and running.

Disclaimer: The dataset for this competition contains text that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive.

Submissions are evaluated using F1 between the predicted and expected answers.

F1 is calculated as follows:
F1=2∗
(precision∗recall)/
(precision+recall)
 
where:

precision=
TP/(TP+FP)
 
recall=
TP/(TP+FN)
 
and:

True Positive [TP] = your prediction is 1, and the ground truth is also 1 - you predicted a positive and that's true!
False Positive [FP] = your prediction is 1, and the ground truth is 0 - you predicted a positive, and that's false.
False Negative [FN] = your prediction is 0, and the ground truth is 1 - you predicted a negative, and that's false.
